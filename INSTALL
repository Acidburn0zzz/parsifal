Installation instructions on Debian Wheezy
-------------------------------------------
Parsifal currently depends on the following OCaml libraries:

* Lwt (>= 2.4.3)
* Calendar
* Cryptokit (>= 1.10)
* Krb5
* OUnit (for some tests)

To compile Parsifal, you also need the following tools:

* Make
* OCaml 4.01
* OCaml-findlib
* OCaml IDL

Therefore, to compile Parsifal, you need to ensure you have the following packages installed:

 * git
 * make
 * ocaml
 * ocaml-findlib
 * camlidl
 * liblwt-ocaml-dev
 * libcalendar-ocaml-dev
 * libcryptokit-ocaml-dev
 * libounit-ocaml-dev
 * libkrb5-dev

When they are installed, you can type in the following commands:
% cd <your_dev_dir>
% git clone https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/parsifal
% cd parsifal
% make

To install the libraries and the binaries in standard directories:
# make install

To install the libraries and the binaries in a custom location, for
example in subdirectories of your home:
% LIBDIR=$HOME/.ocamlpath BINDIR=$HOME/bin make install


Notes
-----

The source code has been checked with Debian Jessie. In particular,
the used OCaml version is 4.01. Due to changes in liblwt internals,
Parsifal is not Debian Wheezy-compatible anymore.

Alternatively, using opam with OCaml 4.01 and Lwt 2.4.3 should work.

Cryptokit added SHA-224/384/512 in its 1.10 release.
