Installation instructions on Debian Wheezy
-------------------------------------------
Parsifal currently depends on the following OCaml libraries:

* Lwt
* Cryptokit
* OUnit (for some tests)

To compile Parsifal, you also need the following tools:

* Make
* OCaml 3.12
* OCaml-findlib

Therefore, to compile Parsifal, you need to ensure you have the following packages installed:

 * git
 * make
 * ocaml
 * ocaml-findlib
 * liblwt-ocaml-dev
 * libcryptokit-ocaml-dev
 * libounit-ocaml-dev

When they are installed, you can type in the following commands:
% cd <your_dev_dir>
% git clone https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/parsifal
% cd parsifal
% make

To install the libraries and the binaries in standard directories:
# make install

To install the libraries and the binaries in a custom location, for
example in subdirectories of your home:
% LIBDIR=$HOME/.ocamlpath BINDIR=$HOME/bin make install


Notes
-----

The source code has been checked with Debian Wheezy. In particular,
the used OCaml version is 3.12.

OCaml 4 compiler is compatible with most of the source code, but might
need minor adapatations.
